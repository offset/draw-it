This program is going to be able to recognize drawn Jump'n'Run levels on photos with Open\-C\-V and convert them so that a simple Jump'n'Run game programmed in S\-F\-M\-L will be able to use it.

\section*{How to build}

This program is currently developed with the I\-D\-E Q\-T-\/\-Creator and qmake, which uses a .pro file for build configuration. If you want to build the program with another I\-D\-E or maybe command line, the following is required\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The Open\-C\-V library and header files (I am using version 2.\-4.\-6)
\item The S\-F\-M\-L library and header files (I am using version 2.\-1)
\item A c++11 compatible c++ compiler (I am using the g++ which is part of the gcc) I havent't build the program without Q\-T-\/\-Creator yet, so I can't give you any further information. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
